# Auto-Labeling-Yolov7
Welcome to my Github repository for auto labeling YOLOv7! This repository contains code and resources for automatically generating labels for object detection using the YOLOv7 model. The goal of this project is to streamline the labeling process for object detection tasks, allowing for more efficient and accurate training of YOLOv7 models. This repository includes scripts for extracting frames from video files, creating bounding boxes around objects of interest, and generating label files in the appropriate format. With these tools, you can easily label large quantities of data with minimal manual effort. Whether you're working on a project for self-driving cars, surveillance systems, or any other object detection application, this repository has the resources you need to get started. So go ahead and clone the repository and get labeling today!
